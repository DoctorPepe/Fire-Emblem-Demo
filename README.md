# StrategyGame
This is my IB Computer Science IA, which is based off of the game created by the Urbana High School programming club. As my project, I decided to expand upon the original framework created by the club to create a battle system for the game. This is the demo of that battle system.

While the original code base is largly the same in style and format, some I have changed some attributes around in order for it to work with my style of code as well. The project is father unfinished, and I dont expect to be getting around to finishing it anytime soon.
